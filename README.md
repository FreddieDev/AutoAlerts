# AutoAlerts
Automatically dismiss popups on Windows. Simply hold `right shift` and choose if you want to auto-close or auto-select an option for a window in the future.

## Warning
This does not work on Windows that load data into their UI after their initial load. This app works best on error messages, warning dialogs or repetitive prompts with hard-coded messages.

**This is a work-in-progress project and is only recommended for developers.**
